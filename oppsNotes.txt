there are fout pillers of object oriented programing 
1.abstraction =>abstraction means hidding the detiels in the heding file like an remote control when we
are using the reomte we just press the buttons and we ger our desire output but we dont know what is working 
behind the button which function is working behined the buttons so same for the class also we have the class 
when we want to use class we just call the class we are no going in detiled we dont konw what is there behiend 
the class so in abstraction we are doing the same thing we are hidng our information behiend the class and its make
our class more secure and redable 
2.encapsulation =>class is an cover inside the cover we have methods and the data members presnt 
defination => finctions  iside a class are called methods (is some language like c#)variabales inside a class 
can also be refered to as "data members"
3.polymorphism i.overloading ii.overriding 
4.inharitence 

what is class what is an object 
ans - class is an plan or file which is allready created and use in the progrmming in simple tream its a
predefined plan use to simplyfy our code and make it secure for example lets assume we have house plan 
so we can use that plan to creat multiple housese no need to creat out recreat the plan agine and agine 
same in the oops we have to declare the function and and we can use the function at any time and with any product 
class simplyfy our code avoide repetation of the code and make it more readable and less complex and object is
an
